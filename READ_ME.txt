Welcome to the family cookbook work in progress. If you find any errors or typos on any of the recipes feel free to let me know and I can fix it. Also let me know if there are any features you would like to see implemented or recipes to be added. The goal of this is to make the family cookbook easier to use and more accessible than either the hard copy or the oneDrive file.

To open the cookbook:
1. open main_dishes
2. open home.html
